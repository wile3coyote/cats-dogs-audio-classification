# Cats and Dogs Audio Classification using CNN

I used the following dataset by Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/mmoreaux/audio-cats-and-dogs) which contains wav audio files of the sounds , the animals make respectively. Download the dataset manually and place it in the same folder as the notebook.

## Description
The librosa library is used to create the spectrograms of all the audio files. A convolutional neural network is then used to train from the spectrograms created from the audio files.

## Prediction
Keep the wav files of the audio to be predicted in the root folder, as an example I added two wav files, of each class respectively.
